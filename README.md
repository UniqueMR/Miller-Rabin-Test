# Miller-Rabin Test

This project is an implementation of the Miller-Rabin test. It can detect whether a given number is prime with extremely high but not 100% confidence. To get more information about the basic theory, check the *Wikipedia* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miller%E2%80%93Rabin_primality_test

## Usage 

To operate the Miller-Rabin test, you can run `python main.py -n <your tested number> -k <your execution round>`.  The tested number and the execution rounds are passed through command line, or you can use the default value.
